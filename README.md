Hi! I'm Rebecca Machado. Nice to meet you! 😊

Currently I am a ServiceNow Senior Analyst working at Accenture Brazil. My job includes mostly working as Tech Lead for projects of ServiceNow Implementation.
My current mainline certifications are: CSA and CIS ITSM.

Besides that, I'm also studying System Analysis and Development at UNISO 👩‍💻 my first graduation is Architecture and Urbanism, so I'm working on getting a second degree.

I LOVE to learn, so I don't limit my studies to only one technology, here are some of the things I'm studying or have done that at some point of my career:
  - ServiceNow ❤️ (my main focus, since I work with that)
  - JavaScript
  - Web Development (JS, HTML, CSS, Razor, PHP)
  - C, C#
  - Python (specially for machine learning using colab from google)
  - ...

For now I'm looking to improve my skills and become a great developer 😎 focusing on ServiceNow but always open to learn new things.
